what is it
--
lurkr is a realtime irc log.

it connects to irc networks and joins channels, then relays their activities
to people connected to a websocket at baseurl/network/channel.

data
--
the current logfile is plain text on disk, appended to as channel traffic
happens

when the logfile reaches a certain size, it is archived (gzip). If someone
wants to see back past the current logfile, they get the gzipped archive
statically with transfer-encoding gzip.

Server has a data directory:
    data/
        moose/
            info.json
            current
            1001200.log
            1001231.log
        moose-dev/
        flea/

search
--
A separate search client (leveraging liblurkr or whatever): you feed it
information about channel api endpoints, it indexes and gives results.

irc
--
bot joins with preconfigured nick, maybe runs a user script (/msg nickserv
identify blah?), talks to socket.io and writes to disk.

federation
--
Code is open source, organizations (moose cabal, perl 6 cabal, etc) are
encouraged to run endpoints for channels relating to their organization.

Individual hackers can have their set-of-watched-channels for their lurkr
instance, that's cool. But maybe they'll utilize #moose's infrastructure too.

Clients talk to things like:  http://moose.org/lurkr/moose,
http://moose.org/lurkr/moose-dev, http://perl6.org/lurkr/freenode,
http://perl6.org/lurkr/magnet, http://lurks.frodwith.net/flea

Searcher is a client. Web interface is a client. Maybe a macgap application
could be a client. Or an iphone app. Whatever!

API
--

lurkr.frodwith.net
    serves up the web client.
    Bookmarkable (hashtag) urls would be nice (just a list of api endpoints)

GET api
    [
        "moose",
        "moose-dev"
    ]

GET api/moose
    {
        "host": "irc.perl.org",
        "port": 6667,
        "channel" : "#moose"
    }

GET api/moose/archive
    [
        10000123,
        10001313,
        48918492
    ]

GET api/moose/archive/10000123
    Transfer-Encoding: gzip
    # newline-separated json, stored gzipped on disk
    { "timestamp": 100000100, "sender": "frodwith", "message": "hello" }
    { "timestamp": 100000101, "sender": "frodwith", "message": "there" }
    { "timestamp": 100000102, "sender": "frodwith", "message": "friend" }

GET api/moose/current
    (see archive, but no gzipping)

io.connect("api/moose/live")
    You get those little bits of json as emit events, live as they happen.
